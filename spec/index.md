## System Overview

ECD (Error Capture Diagnostics) is a single npm package (`@ecd/sdk`) that instruments a Node.js process to continuously record I/O and request context at low overhead. When an error occurs, it captures a self-contained "error package" containing everything needed to deterministically reproduce the error in an isolated environment.

The SDK is `require()`'d at the top of the user's entry point. It must not break the host process, must not leak PII, and must degrade gracefully when it cannot capture complete context.

---

## Architecture Summary

The SDK has four continuous recording layers plus an on-demand error-time capture:

1. **I/O Recording** — Subscribes to `diagnostics_channel` and monkey-patches database drivers to record all inbound/outbound I/O into a fixed-size circular buffer.
2. **Request Context Binding** — Uses `AsyncLocalStorage` to correlate I/O events to individual inbound HTTP requests.
3. **State Tracking** — Uses `Proxy` to record reads from user-registered in-memory state containers (opt-in).
4. **Error-Time Capture** — On error, assembles a self-contained `ErrorPackage` from the buffer, ALS context, V8 inspector local variables, process metadata, and completeness flags.

All components are plain classes with constructor-injected dependencies. The composition root (`sdk.ts`) is the only place where components are instantiated and wired together.

## Development Scope

- Pure JS/TS, zero native dependencies
- Package name: `@ecd/sdk`
- CommonJS with conditional ESM exports
- Ships compiled JS + `.d.ts` declarations
- Test runner: vitest

## Strict Build Order

Modules MUST be implemented in this exact order. Each module depends only on modules above it. An implementation agent MUST NOT begin a module until all of its dependencies are complete.

## Cross-Cutting Invariants

These rules apply to ALL modules. Every module specification references them where relevant.

### GC Safety Invariant

All data stored in long-lived SDK data structures (circular buffer, state read arrays, inspector locals cache) MUST be self-contained plain objects with NO references to host application objects (`IncomingMessage`, `ServerResponse`, `Socket`, `ClientRequest`, etc.). At recording time, synchronously extract needed scalar values into plain fields. Replace entire slot references on overwrite for atomic unreachability.

### Dependency Injection

Every component is a plain class with constructor-injected dependencies. No component imports another component's module directly. The composition root (`sdk.ts`) is the only file that imports all component classes. Module-level mutable state exists only in `index.ts` (one `SDKInstance` reference).

### Serialization Limits

All arbitrary-value serialization uses `cloneAndLimit()` with structural bounds (depth, array items, object keys, string length). Two profiles: Standard (capture time) and Tight (state-read time). See [02-serialization](02-serialization.md).

### Shutdown Contract

Every component that holds timers, listeners, or sessions exposes a `shutdown()` method. The SDK orchestrates teardown in reverse-initialization order. All timers use `.unref()`. See [16-sdk-composition](16-sdk-composition.md).

---

## Testing Expectations

- **Unit tests:** Every module has isolated unit tests using vitest. Components are instantiated with real or mock dependencies. No module-level state to clean up between tests.
- **Integration tests:** Full SDK instances created via `createSDK()` (not the module-level `init()`). Tests verify end-to-end flows: HTTP recording, inspector capture, full error capture, middleware context propagation, transport delivery, and shutdown completeness.
- **Performance tests:** Steady-state overhead < 5% CPU and < 100MB additional RSS. Error capture latency < 500ms. Buffer push rate > 1M events/second. Tight-profile serialization < 10 microseconds.

---

## Security Requirements

- PII scrubbed by default on all captured data (headers, bodies, local variables, db params, env vars, file paths).
- Error packages encrypted with AES-256-GCM when an encryption key is configured. Warning logged if no key provided.
- Transport enforces HTTPS for HTTP endpoints (overridable for dev).
- Inspector session used strictly for `Runtime.getProperties` during `Debugger.paused`. Never exposes session externally. Never evaluates expressions from external input.
- Circular buffer contents never written to disk in raw form. Only scrubbed, encrypted error packages leave the process.
- Rate limiting prevents capture amplification under high error rates (default 10 captures/minute).

---

## Performance Guarantees

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Steady-state CPU overhead | < 5% |
| Steady-state memory overhead | < 100 MB |
| Error capture latency | < 500 ms |
| Inspector idle CPU | < 2% |
| Inspector with 100 caught exceptions/sec | < 5% CPU |
| Buffer push throughput | > 1M events/sec |
| Tight-profile cloneAndLimit | < 10 microseconds |

---

## Implementation Guardrails

1. Agents implement exactly ONE module at a time.
2. Agents only modify files listed in that module's specification.
3. Agents follow the build order defined above. Never skip ahead.
4. Agents load only the relevant spec file plus `index.md` for context. Do NOT load the entire architecture plan.
5. If a specification is unclear or contradictory, the agent MUST stop and ask rather than invent behavior.
6. Agents must NOT redesign the system, introduce alternative architectures, change data structures, or reinterpret subsystem responsibilities.
7. Every source file must begin with a **module contract header** comment that states the file's purpose, its module spec reference, and its injected dependencies.
